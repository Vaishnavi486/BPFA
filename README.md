**Task: Mapping the Receiving and Inventory Put-Away Process**

**Overview:**
As a Business Analyst, I was responsible for mapping the receiving and inventory put-away process for a small company, involving two key actors: the Receiver and the Inventory Supervisor. This task required the use of Microsoft Visio and the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) method to accurately depict the workflow, decision points, and communication steps in the inventory management process.

**Key Responsibilities:**

•	Process Mapping: Created a comprehensive BPMN diagram using Microsoft Visio to map out the steps involved in receiving and processing shipments at the dock.

•	Actor Roles: Defined the roles of the Receiver and the Inventory Supervisor, outlining their specific responsibilities from checking shipments for damage to assigning inventory locations.

•	Decision Points: Mapped decision points such as determining whether a shipment is damaged, the type of inventory, and whether internal or external inventory needs to be processed.

•	Notifications: Included email notifications to internal employees and communication with IT and Finance in cases where inventory discrepancies occurred.

**Skills Utilized:**

•	Microsoft Visio (Process Mapping)

•	BPMN Methodology

•	Workflow Analysis and Documentation

•	Communication and Notification Processes
